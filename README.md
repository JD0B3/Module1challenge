But in my opinion the success of users through assessing their pnl from the beginning of funding an account, viewing their success rate or failure after using the platform in their new investing journy. Analizing their stocks and crypto trades, to see users preferences.

The hype around crypto and stocks since the pandic has worn off, the economic overall situation and prices devaluation from their all time highs have made in my opinion, users skeptical about the certainty of these financial instruments result and have drive growth throughout the market as a whole, down. Robinhood is underperforming as well as their competitors, due to the overall economic situation we are currently living.
